# Medical Bill Upload Application

This is a web application I made for the Truffle Health frontend assessment that allows users to upload and submit medical bills. It provides a form for users to enter the details of the medical bill and upload an image of the bill. Users can review the entered information before submitting the bill. Submitted bills are then displayed on a billboard.

## Features

- Create and submit medical bills with patient details and bill information.
- Upload bill images to accompany the submitted bills.
- Review the entered information before submitting the bill.
- View submitted bills on a billboard.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: State management library for managing the application's global state.
- React Router: Library for handling routing within the React application.
- React Hook Form: Library for handling form validation and submission.
- CSS: Styling the user interface.

## Usage

1. On the home page, view the already added bills and add new bills.
2. Fill in the required details in the form fields, including the patient name, address, hospital, date, bill amount, and upload a bill image.
3. Click on the "Review" button to review the entered information.
4. If any errors occur during form submission, they will be displayed next to the corresponding form fields.
5. On the review page, you can see the entered information. Click on the "Edit Bill" button to go back and make changes, or click on the "Submit" button to submit the bill.
6. Submitted bills will be displayed on the billboard.
